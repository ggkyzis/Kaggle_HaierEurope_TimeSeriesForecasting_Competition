# Time-Series-Forecasting
My solution for Haier Europe Forecasting Hackathon with Python.  The goal is to forecast short-term 12 weeks weekly product level forecast and mid-term 3 months monthly aggregated level of the forecast.

My implementation initially tried to tackle an AutoML and Low-Code approach based on statistical forecasting. Afterwards, I transitioned to XGBRegressor and LGBMRegressor that indicate higher complexity. My experiments had different number of lags and parameters.
My preference language was Python, and due to the high complexity of the problem I performed error-handling in each process and automated the forecasting of each univariate time series.
